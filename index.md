## Projects

### Mondrian Art Generator using Recursive Partitioning
• Built a recursive image-partitioning algorithm to generate Mondrian-style artwork by subdividing canvases based
on size thresholds and aspect ratios handling hundreds of recursive calls per render
• Increased visual coherence by weighting color selection probabilities per quadrant while ensuring termination and
balance through minimum region constraints and test cases for edge canvas sizes and extreme aspect ratios

---

### Disaster Relief Resource Allocator
• Implemented a recursive backtracking algorithm to maximize total population served under strict budget constraints
across multiple regions with correctness validated by targeted test cases including worst-case inputs
• Reduced effective search space by 60% using pruning and early termination, improving runtime from exponential
brute force to tractable performance on inputs of up to 15 regions

---

### Mini-Git (Version Control System Prototype)
• Built a version control system supporting commit creation, history traversal, and repository state tracking
• Developed 15+ unit tests ensuring robustness across edge cases using custom linked data structures in O(n) time

## Experience

### Laboratory for Auditory Neuroscience and Development — UW  
**Undergraduate Research Assistant (Engineering)**  
• Developed and optimized MATLAB and Python scripts for EEG signal processing and acoustic data analysis
• Analyzed large-scale EEG and audio datasets in studies on auditory processing (PitchMMN, MultiIDS) for over 100
infants (ages 7 – 11 months), contributing to algorithmic modeling and research publications
• Leveraged Kaldi ASR framework via Montreal Forced Aligner to produce time-aligned phoneme transcriptions,
integrating linguistic data into analysis pipelines on 100% of MultiIDS conditions

---

### Sensoria Health — Software Engineer Intern  
• Developed and prototyped wearable IoT devices (smart socks/boots) with textile pressure sensors, 9-axis IMUs, and
BLE-enabled Core microelectronics for real-time gait monitoring designed for patient monitoring
• Calibrated sensor circuitry and optimized analog-to-digital signal flow of over 100,000 data points to ensure reliable
Bluetooth communication to Sensoria’s mobile app for AI powered rehabilitation insights
• Validated device performance with pressure testing, troubleshooting I²C/SPI data and improving hardware

---

### STEM for Others — Software Developer  
• Contributed to iOS and frontend development for STEMplore, an educational app for increasing STEM learning for
over 11,500 + students with over 130 programs and 35 courses and volunteer involvement of over 700 participants
• Developed cross-platform features using Swift for iOS and Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS for the web interface
• Collaborated on UI/UX improvements and feature expansion to enhance interactivity across devices
